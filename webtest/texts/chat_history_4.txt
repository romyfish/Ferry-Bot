Hi I wonder how to comfort others
To comfort others, it's important to ask open-ended questions like "How have you been feeling these days?" and show empathy in your responses. You can also invite them to offline activities gently, such as "Would you be interested in joining a calm evening walk with some of us this week?"
Yeah, but what can I say when I cannot solve their troubles for them
You can offer empathetic responses like "I'm here for you" or "I understand this must be really tough for you." Encourage them to share their feelings and remind them that you're there to listen and support them.
Right, I just don't think it's enough to say something, and I can't do any substantial thing to help
Sometimes just being there to listen and show support can make a big difference. You can also suggest seeking professional help or resources if needed. Remember, your presence and empathy can be very comforting to someone in need.
that's right. What else you can teach me to be a peer supporter?
In addition to listening and showing empathy, you can also encourage self-care activities like exercise, healthy eating, and relaxation techniques. Invite members to offline activities like walks or group outings to help them unwind. Remember to always respect their privacy and individual needs.
Sounds great
I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful! If you have any more questions or need further guidance on supporting your peers, feel free to ask.
