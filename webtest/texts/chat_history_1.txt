Hi! I notice you haven't been active lately and want to check in. How's it going these days?
A bit sad
I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about what's been making you feel sad?
no idea, just not interested in anything
I understand how that feels. Have you been getting enough rest and eating well lately?
I tried. I always go to bed with the thought of eating something good tomorrow, but then I wake up the next day and don't want to eat anything!
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're struggling with your appetite. Have you been able to find any foods that you enjoy eating lately?
Sometimes I buy a sandwich, sometimes I just eat some snacks only when I'm hungry
It's good that you're trying to eat something, even if it's just snacks. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels when you do eat something?
No energy always. It's boring to eat alone
I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling low on energy. Eating alone can indeed feel lonely. Is there anyone you feel comfortable reaching out to for a meal or snack together?
maybe I should talk to my sister but I'm afraid to reach out. It's better to chat with you
I'm glad you feel comfortable chatting with me. It's okay to feel hesitant about reaching out to your sister. Is there a particular reason you feel afraid to talk to her?
It's complicated, but yeah thanks
I understand that it can be complicated. Just know that I'm here to listen whenever you feel like talking. Take care of yourself, okay?
Okay
If you ever need to talk or share more, I'm here for you. Remember to take care of yourself and reach out whenever you need support.
